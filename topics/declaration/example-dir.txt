Library file layout

The layout of your declaration files should mirror the layout of the library.

A library can consist of multiple modules, such as

myLib
  +---- index.js
  +---- foo.js
  +---- bar
         +---- index.js
         +---- baz.js

These could be imported as

var a = require("myLib");
var b = require("myLib/foo");
var c = require("myLib/bar");
var d = require("myLib/bar/baz");

Your declaration files should thus be

@types/myLib
  +---- index.d.ts
  +---- foo.d.ts
  +---- bar
         +---- index.d.ts
         +---- baz.d.ts
